To start syncing Single File models, save them in this directory, they will be uploaded as private models to your Thangs account

To sync a single file model with supporting files (images, reference files), do the following:

- Create a folder under this folder for the model.  The name of the model when it syncs to Thangs
  will match the name of this folder
- Place the files for the model underneath that new folder
- If you have supporting files for the model (images, reference files) you can place them under this folder as well.
  Thangs Sync will attach them to your model as either an image or a reference file based on its extension.


To sync a multi-part model (models to that consist of multiple parts, with each part being a separate file),
do the following:

- Create a folder under this folder (or the Multipart Models if you already have one and want to use it) for the model.
  The name of the model when it syncs to Thangs will match the name of this folder
- Place the files for the model underneath that new folder
- If you have supporting files for the model (images, reference files) you can place them under this folder as well.
  Thangs Sync will attach them to your model as either an image or a reference file based on its extension.


Thangs and Thangs Sync support the following file extensions:
